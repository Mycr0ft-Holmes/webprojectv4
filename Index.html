        <h1>World's Petition Platfrom</h1>

        <p>
            We started in 2016 with the radical idea that anyone, anywhere, should be able to
            easily and securely to start their own petition. <br>Today, we offer a trusted and easy-to-use platform 
            for social movement across the world.

        <h1>Our Story</h1>

        <div class="content4txt">
            <p>April 2016 when I was working part-time at a travel
                agency. At that time, there was an environmental
                problem in my country that made many people angry and
                they created a petition on Change dot org and shared it
                on Facebook. I am very interested in the idea of this
                website, it is really helpful and it has a strong life impact.
                I wonder why there is not such a website in my country? I
                think every country should have such a website and the
                world should have more than one in the community. So I
                decided to quit my part-time job and start developing a
                platform for social movements.
                Although I have some experience developing websites on
                WordPress at my company, I still face many challenges to
                develop and design. I work almost 12 hours a day, after
                10 months the first version is released. I kept improving it
                over the next 3 years with hundreds of changes and new
                features added.
                Today, hundreds of websites powered by Campoal are
                running around the world, millions of people are signing to
                support for the problem they care about, starting social
                movements and making changes to make their country a
                better place. People have used websites to change tax
                laws in France, raise funds to protect animals in Germany,
                speak out about social problems in Turkey, Calls for an
                end to war in Middle Eastern countries Fundraising to help
                children in Africa and more.
                By empowering entrepreneurs and organizations to give
                people the opportunity to talk about their problems, I
                believe that anyone can make the world a better place.
